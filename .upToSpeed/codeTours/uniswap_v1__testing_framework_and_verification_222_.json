In the swap_input function:\n\n1. A 0.3% fee is applied to the input amount (997/1000).\n2. The numerator (input_amount_with_fee * output_reserve) represents the ideal output amount.\n3. The denominator (input_reserve * 1000 + input_amount_with_fee) accounts for the new input reserve after the swap.\n4.

As auditors, you should look for similar patterns in other DeFi protocols: thorough testing of core functions, verification of economic invariants, and explicit checks for potential attack vectors.","title":"","id":"2003"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"As we conclude our examination of Uniswap V1's testing suite, let's consider how these practices apply to auditing more complex DeFi systems like Uniswap V4:\n\n1. Comprehensive Coverage: Ensure all core functions, especially those handling funds or critical state changes, have extensive test coverage.\n\n2. Economic Invariants: Verify that key economic principles (e.g., constant product formula) are maintained across all possible interactions.\n\n3. Edge Cases and Attack Vectors: Test boundary conditions and potential attack scenarios, such as flash loan attacks or price manipulation attempts.\n\n4. Upgrade Mechanisms: For upgradeable contracts, thoroughly test the upgrade process and potential vulnerabilities in proxy patterns.\n\n5. Integration Testing: As systems become more interconnected, focus on testing interactions between different components and external protocols.\n\n6. Formal Verification: Consider employing formal verification techniques for critical parts of the system to mathematically prove correctness.\n\nWhen auditing advanced protocols, apply these principles rigorously, adapting them to the specific architecture and features of the system under review. Remember, as complexity increases, so does the importance of systematic and comprehensive testing.","title":"","id":"2004"}]}
