Let's break it down:\n\n1. input_amount_with_fee = input_amount * 997\n   This applies a 0.3% fee (3/1000) to the input amount.\n\n2. numerator = input_amount_with_fee * output_reserve\n   This part calculates the product of the fee-adjusted input and the current output reserve.\n\n3. denominator = (input_reserve * 1000) + input_amount_with_fee\n   This adds the fee-adjusted input to the scaled input reserve.\n\n4. return numerator / denominator\n   This division gives the final output amount.\n\nThis function maintains the constant product formula (x * y = k) while accounting for fees.
