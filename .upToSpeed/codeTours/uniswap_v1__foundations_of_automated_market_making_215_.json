{"title":"Uniswap V1: Foundations of Automated Market Making","id":"zL9T45wL461hLNGI5EBvMAgGBFtkOEUY5AzVtxNjYN8=","steps":[{"type":"textOnly","description":"Welcome to the Uniswap V1 code tour! Uniswap V1 is a groundbreaking decentralized exchange protocol built on Ethereum. It introduced the concept of automated market-making using liquidity pools, which revolutionized token trading. As we explore the codebase, we'll uncover the core mechanisms that make Uniswap work and set the foundation for future versions.","title":"","id":"1925"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy"],"description":"The Exchange contract is the core of Uniswap V1, managing individual token pairs and handling swaps and liquidity provision. It implements the automated market-making mechanism using liquidity pools. Let's examine its structure and key components.","title":"","id":"1974"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The addLiquidity function allows users to provide liquidity to the exchange.

It uses the constant product formula (x * y = k) to determine the price of trades. This function ensures that larger trades have higher slippage, maintaining balance in the pool.","file":"contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy","highlight":[{"start":104,"end":111}],"title":"","id":"1978"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["contracts/uniswap_factory.vy"],"description":"The Factory contract acts as the central registry for all Exchange contracts. It creates new exchanges for token pairs and keeps track of them. The createExchange function is crucial as it deploys new Exchange contracts for each token.","title":"","id":"1927"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The getInputPrice function implements Uniswap's core pricing mechanism using the constant product formula (x * y = k). This formula ensures that the product of the two token reserves remains constant after trades.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. input_amount_with_fee = input_amount * 997 // Applies a 0.3% fee\n2. numerator = input_amount_with_fee * output_reserve\n3. denominator = (input_reserve * 1000) + input_amount_with_fee\n4. return numerator / denominator\n\nThis implementation maintains liquidity by making larger trades proportionally more expensive. As the input amount increases, the output amount grows at a decreasing rate, creating slippage. This mechanism protects the pool from being drained and ensures fair pricing for all traders.","file":"contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy","highlight":[{"start":104,"end":111}],"title":"","id":"1928"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The addLiquidity function is crucial for Uniswap's automated market-making system. It allows users to provide liquidity to the exchange, creating the token pools that enable decentralized trading.\n\nKey points:\n1. Initial liquidity: The first provider sets the initial exchange rate.\n2. Subsequent additions: Must maintain the current reserve ratio.\n3. Liquidity tokens: Providers receive these as proof of their share.\n\nImportantly, liquidity providers should be aware of impermanent loss - a potential loss faced when the price of deposited assets changes compared to simply holding them.\n\nStudy how the function calculates token amounts and mints liquidity tokens. This mechanism ensures the pool's stability while incentivizing liquidity provision.","file":"contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy","highlight":[{"start":46,"end":74}],"title":"","id":"1929"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The ethToTokenSwapInput function showcases how Uniswap handles token swaps.
